remotes::install_github("iris-yi-jiang/moostr")
```
## Overview

`moostr` generates a Moodle syntax string for a given list of possible answers 
and their corresponding rewards. It allows the user to conveniently allocate 
rewards for multiple correct and partially correct answers. For multichoice 
questions, `moostr` also randomly shuffles the answer list. For numerical 
questions, `moostr` also allows the flexibility to specify different tolerance 
levels for each possible answer.

For `moostr` to function properly, it is necessary to set the question type for 
both multichoice and numerical questions to vertatim type. The returned Moodle 
syntax string can then be directly used as the solution to a verbatim item in 
an Embedded Answers (Cloze) exercise with `exams` or Moodle. 

## Example

This is a basic example for mutichoice question type. Note that `moostr` 
shuffles the answer list.

```{r example_multichoice, eval=TRUE}
library(moostr)
make_moostr(type="mchoice", 
            ans=c("A two-sample t-test",
                  "A paired t-test", 
                  "A one-sample t-test"), 
            reward=c(50, 100, 0))
```

This is a basic example for numerical question type. Note that `moostr` allows
the flexibly to specify different tolerance levels for each possible answer. If
the same tolerance level is preferred across all possible answers, only a single
tolerance level is needed for the tol argument. The tol argument is by default
set to 0.01, so if this is the preferred tolerance level, then it is not necessary
to set it. 

The tol argument should be set carefully. If the difference between correct and
partially correct answers are within the specified tolerance level, then the 
reward applied to the partially correct answer will be ignored and the reward for 
the correct answer will be used to evaluate both answers.

```{r example_num, eval=TRUE}
library(moostr)
make_moostr(type="num", 
            ans=c(2, 2.1, 2.01), 
            reward=c(30, 100, 50),
            tol = c(0, 0.1, 0.01))
make_moostr(type="num", 
            ans=c(2, 2.1, 2.01), 
            reward=c(30, 100, 50),
            tol = 0.1)
make_moostr(type="num", 
            ans=c(2, 2.1, 2.01), 
            reward=c(30, 100, 50))
```
